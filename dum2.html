<font size="3">Algebraic Eqaution statement of the equality of two expressions formulated by applying to a set of variables
the algebraic operations,namely,addition,subtraction,multiplication,division, raising to a power, and extract of a root. Example
 are x<sup>2</sup> + 1 and (y<sup>4</sup>x<sup>2</sup> + 2xy - y<sup>1</sup?>)/(x - 1) = 12.
 An important special case of such equations is that of polynomial equations, expressions of the  form axn + bxn <sup>-1</sup>+,,,+ <sub>gx</sub>+ h = k.
 they many as sulotion as their digree (<em>n</em>), and the search of their sulotions stemulated much of the development of classical and modern algebra. 
 equations like x sin (x) = that involved nonalgebraic operations, such as algorithms or trigonometric functions, are said to be transcendental.	</font>

 with a fixid ration determining the composition.the ratio of each element is usually expressed by chemical formula.or example (H2O)
 is a compound consisting of two hydrogen atoms bonded to an oxygen atom.the atoms within its compound can be held together by a viarity of interactions,
 raging from covalent bounds to electrostatic force in lonic bounds.</h2></font>
