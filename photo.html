                        <p><font color="white">The country's tallest mountain and one of its most iconic symbols is a popular destination for outdoor recreation. For centuries, Japanese artists and poets have been inspired by Mount Fuji's almost perfectly round form. The Fuji Five Lakes region at the foot of this UNESCO World Heritage Site makes a great base for the thousands of climbers who visit each year. Enjoy the area's museums and amusement park during the warmer months. Or, arrive in winter to soak in the hot springs and ski Mount Fuji's slopes.</p></font>

                        <h2><font color="yellow"><font size="5">Welcome to Paris </h2></font>
                        <p><font color="white"> Paris is easily recognizable and one of the most famous cities in the world. Many of France ‘s best features collide here: leafy boulevards filled with classic buildings, lush parks, world class sculpture, trendy boutiques … The nightlife is active all over the area. It’s normal to see a lot of people coming up late in the downtown neighbourhoods during the warmer months. Paris isn’t risky so you have to be as vigilant as any major city. If you intend to return to your apartment later, you can inquire about the transit network-the subway only runs until 12.30pm.</p></font>

But travelers come to Zao not only for the snow-capped mountain but the trees. Extreme snow and seasonal winds cocoon the mountain's pine trees during the coldest winter months, creating snow towers in obscure forms known as "ice monsters" or Juhyo in Japanese.</p></font>
